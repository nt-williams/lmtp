> Non-parametric Causal Effects of Feasible Interventions Based on
> Modified Treatment Policies

Nick Williams and Ivan Diaz

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**lmtp** is an R package that provides an estimation framework for the
casual effects of feasible interventions based on point-treatment and
longitudinal modified treatment policies as described in Diaz, Williams,
Hoffman, and Schenck (2020). Two primary estimators are supported, a
targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator and a sequentially doubly
robust (SDR) estimator (a G-computation and an inverse probability of
treatment weighting estimator are provided for the sake of being
thorough but their use is recommended against in favor of the TML and
SDR estimators). Both binary and continuous outcomes (both with
censoring) are allowed. **lmtp** is built atop the
[`mlr3superlearner`](https://github.com/nt-williams/mlr3superlearner)
package to utilize ensemble machine learning for estimation. The
treatment mechanism is estimated via a density ratio classification
procedure irrespective of treatment variable type providing decreased
computation time when treatment is continuous. Dynamic treatment regimes
are also supported.

A list of papers using **lmtp** is
[here](https://gist.github.com/nt-williams/15068f5849a67ff4d2cb7f2dcf97b3de).

For an in-depth look at the package’s functionality, please consult the
accompanying technical paper in [Observational
Studies](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/883479).

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("nt-williams/lmtp@mlr3superlearner")
```

## What even is a modified treatment policy?

Modified treatment policies (MTP) are interventions that can depend on
the *natural* value of the treatment (the treatment value in the absence
of intervention). A key assumption for causal inference is the
*positivity assumption* which states that all observations have a
non-zero probability of experiencing a treatment value. **When working
with continuous or multivalued treatments, violations of the positivity
assumption are likely to occur. MTPs offer a solution to this problem.**

## Can lmtp estimate other effects?

Yes! **lmtp** can estimate the effects of deterministic, static
treatment effects (such as the ATE) and deterministic, dynamic treatment
regimes for binary, continuous, and survival outcomes.

## Example

``` r
library(lmtp)
#> Loading required package: mlr3superlearner
#> Loading required package: mlr3learners
#> Loading required package: mlr3

# the data: 4 treatment nodes with time varying covariates and a binary outcome
head(sim_t4)
#>   ID L_1 A_1 L_2 A_2 L_3 A_3 L_4 A_4 Y
#> 1  1   2   3   0   1   1   1   1   3 0
#> 2  2   2   1   1   4   0   3   1   2 0
#> 3  3   1   0   1   3   1   2   1   1 1
#> 4  4   1   0   0   3   1   3   1   2 0
#> 5  5   3   3   1   1   0   1   1   2 0
#> 6  6   1   0   0   2   0   3   1   4 0
```

We’re interested in a treatment policy, `d`, where exposure is decreased
by 1 only among subjects whose exposure won’t go below 1 if intervened
upon. The true population outcome under this policy is about 0.305.

``` r
# a treatment policy function to be applied at all time points
policy <- function(data, trt) {
  (data[[trt]] - 1) * (data[[trt]] - 1 >= 1) + data[[trt]] * (data[[trt]] - 1 < 1)
}
```

In addition to specifying a treatment policy, we need to specify our
treatment variables and time-varying covariates.

``` r
# treatment nodes, a character vector of length 4
A <- c("A_1", "A_2", "A_3", "A_4")
# time varying nodes, a list of length 4
L <- list(c("L_1"), c("L_2"), c("L_3"), c("L_4"))
```

We can now estimate the effect of our treatment policy, `d`. In this
example, we’ll use the cross-validated TML estimator with 10 folds.

``` r
lmtp_tmle(sim_t4, A, "Y", time_vary = L, shift = policy, intervention_type = "mtp", folds = 10)
#> LMTP Estimator: TMLE
#>    Trt. Policy: (policy)
#> 
#> Population intervention estimate
#>       Estimate: 0.2526
#>     Std. error: 0.0223
#>         95% CI: (0.2089, 0.2962)
```

## Similar Implementations

A variety of other R packages perform similar tasks as **lmtp**.
However, **lmtp** is the only R package currently capable of estimating
causal effects for binary, categorical, and continuous exposures in both
the point treatment and longitudinal setting using traditional causal
effects or modified treatment policies.
