Description: Non-parametric estimators for casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment 
  policies as described in Diaz, Williams, and Hoffman (2020) <arXiv:...>, traditional point treatment, 
  and traditional longitudinal effects. Continuous, binary, and categorical treatments are allowed as well are 
  censored outcomes. The treatment mechanism is estimated via a density ratio classification procedure 
  irrespective of treatment variable type. Estimation is performed using the Super Learner from `sl3`. 
  For both continuous and binary outcomes, additive treatment effects can be calculated and relative 
  risks and odds ratios may be calculated for binary outcomes.
