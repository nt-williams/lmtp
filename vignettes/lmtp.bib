	abstract = {Modern longitudinal studies feature data collected at many timepoints, often of the same order of sample size. Such studies are typically affected by dropout and positivity violations. We tackle these problems by generalizing effects of recent incremental interventions (which shift propensity scores rather than set treatment values deterministically) to accommodate multiple outcomes and subject dropout. We give an identifying expression for incremental effects when dropout is conditionally ignorable (without requiring treatment positivity), and derive the nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating such effects. Then we present efficient nonparametric estimators, showing that they converge at fast parametric rates and yield uniform inferential guarantees, even when nuisance functions are estimated flexibly at slower rates. We also study the efficiency of incremental effects relative to more conventional deterministic effects in a novel infinite time horizon setting, where the number of timepoints grows with sample size, and show that incremental effects yield near-exponential gains in this setup. Finally we conclude with simulations and apply our methods in a study of the effect of low-dose aspirin on pregnancy outcomes.},

	abstract = {Most work in causal inference considers deterministic interventions that set each unit’s treatment to some fixed value. However, under positivity violations these interventions can lead to nonidentification, inefficiency, and effects with little practical relevance. Further, corresponding effects in longitudinal studies are highly sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, resulting in widespread use of unrealistic parametric models. We propose a novel solution to these problems: incremental interventions that shift propensity score values rather than set treatments to fixed values. Incremental interventions have several crucial advantages. First, they avoid positivity assumptions entirely. Second, they require no parametric assumptions and yet still admit a simple characterization of longitudinal effects, independent of the number of timepoints. For example, they allow longitudinal effects to be visualized with a single curve instead of lists of coefficients. After characterizing incremental interventions and giving identifying conditions for corresponding effects, we also develop general efficiency theory, propose efficient nonparametric estimators that can attain fast convergence rates even when incorporating flexible machine learning, and propose a bootstrap-based confidence band and simultaneous test of no treatment effect. Finally, we explore finite-sample performance via simulation, and apply the methods to study time-varying sociological effects of incarceration on entry into marriage.

	abstract = {Motivated by a study of surgical operating time and post-operative outcomes for lung cancer, we consider the estimation of causal effects of continuous point-exposure treatments. To investigate causality, the standard paradigm postulates a series of treatment-specific counterfactual outcomes and establishes conditions under which we may learn about them from observational study data. While many choices are possible, causal effects are typically defined in terms of variation of the mean of counterfactual outcomes in hypothetical worlds in which specific treatment strategies are ‘applied’ to all individuals. For example, one might compare two worlds: one where each individual receives some specific dose and a second where each individual receives some other dose. For our motivating study, defining causal effects in this way corresponds to (hypothetical) interventions that could not conceivably be implemented in the real world. In this work, we consider an alternative, complimentary framework that investigates variation in the mean of counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical treatment strategies where each individual receives a treatment dose corresponding to that actually received but modified in some pre-specified way. Quantification of this variation is defined in terms of contrasts for specific interventions as well as in terms of the parameters of a new class of marginal structural mean models. Within this framework, we propose three estimators: an outcome regression estimator, an inverse probability of treatment weighted estimator and a doubly robust estimator. We illustrate the methods with an analysis of the motivating data. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},

This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners.  In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions.

	title = {Non-parametric causal effects based on longitudinal modified treatment policies},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01366},
	abstract = {Most causal inference methods consider counterfactual variables under interventions that set the treatment deterministically. With continuous or multi-valued treatments or exposures, such counterfactuals may be of little practical interest because no feasible intervention can be implemented that would bring them about. Furthermore, violations to the positivity assumption, necessary for identification, are exacerbated with continuous and multi-valued treatments and deterministic interventions. In this paper we propose longitudinal modified treatment policies (LMTPs) as a non-parametric alternative. LMTPs can be designed to guarantee positivity, and yield effects of immediate practical relevance with an interpretation that is familiar to regular users of linear regression adjustment. We study the identification of the LMTP parameter, study properties of the statistical estimand such as the efficient influence function, and propose four different estimators. Two of our estimators are efficient, and one is sequentially doubly robust in the sense that it is consistent if, for each time point, either an outcome regression or a treatment mechanism is consistently estimated. We perform a simulation study to illustrate the properties of the estimators, and present the results of our motivating study on hypoxemia and mortality in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients.

	abstract = {We revisit the classic semi-parametric problem of inference on a low-dimensional parameter θ0 in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters η0. We depart from the classical setting by allowing for η0 to be so high-dimensional that the traditional assumptions (e.g. Donsker properties) that limit complexity of the parameter space for this object break down. To estimate η0, we consider the use of statistical or machine learning (ML) methods, which are particularly well suited to estimation in modern, very high-dimensional cases. ML methods perform well by employing regularization to reduce variance and trading off regularization bias with overfitting in practice. However, both regularization bias and overfitting in estimating η0 cause a heavy bias in estimators of θ0 that are obtained by naively plugging ML estimators of η0 into estimating equations for θ0. This bias results in the naive estimator failing to be consistent, where N is the sample size. We show that the impact of regularization bias and overfitting on estimation of the parameter of interest θ0 can be removed by using two simple, yet critical, ingredients: (1) using Neyman-orthogonal moments/scores that have reduced sensitivity with respect to nuisance parameters to estimate θ0; (2) making use of cross-fitting, which provides an efficient form of data-splitting. We call the resulting set of methods double or debiased ML (DML). We verify that DML delivers point estimators that concentrate in an -neighbourhood of the true parameter values and are approximately unbiased and normally distributed, which allows construction of valid confidence statements. The generic statistical theory of DML is elementary and simultaneously relies on only weak theoretical requirements, which will admit the use of a broad array of modern ML methods for estimating the nuisance parameters, such as random forests, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, and various hybrids and ensembles of these methods. We illustrate the general theory by applying it to provide theoretical properties of the following: DML applied to learn the main regression parameter in a partially linear regression model; DML applied to learn the coefficient on an endogenous variable in a partially linear instrumental variables model; DML applied to learn the average treatment effect and the average treatment effect on the treated under unconfoundedness; DML applied to learn the local average treatment effect in an instrumental variables setting. In addition to these theoretical applications, we also illustrate the use of DML in three empirical examples.},

The parametric g-formula, which appropriately adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Over the period 1982–2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50\%. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89\% (95\% confidence interval: 1.46–2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses’ Health Study data.

Professional groups and nonprofits, such as the American College of Physicians and the American Heart Association, gave HRT their stamp of approval 15 years ago. Studies indicated that HRT was protective against osteoporosis and heart disease. HRT became big business, with millions upon millions of prescriptions filled each year. However, in 1998, the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study demonstrated increased risk of heart attack among women with heart disease taking HRT, and in 2002 the Women’s Health Initiative showed increased risk for breast cancer, heart disease, and stroke, among other ailments, for women on HRT.

Just like model-based maximum likelihood learning, Bayesian learning is intrinsically nontargeted by working with the prior and posterior distributions of the whole probability distribution of the observed data structure and is thereby very susceptible to bias due to model misspecification or nontargeted model selection.},

	abstract = {An estimator of a parameter is a mapping from the data set to the parameter space. Estimators that are empirical means of a function of the unit data structure are asymptotically consistent and normally distributed due to the CLT. Such estimators are called linear in the empirical probability distribution. Most estimators are not linear, but many are approximately linear in the sense that they are linear up to a negligible (in probability) remainder term. One states that the estimator is asymptotically linear, and the relevant function of the unit data structure, centered to have mean zero, is called the influence curve of the estimator. How does one prove that an estimator is asymptotically linear? One key step is to realize that an estimator is a mapping from a possibly very large collection of empirical means of functions of the unit data structure into the parameter space. Such a collection of empirical means is called an empirical process whose behavior with respect to uniform consistency and the uniform CLT is established in empirical process theory. In this section we present succinctly that (1) a uniform central limit theorem for the vector of empirical means, combined with (2) differentiability of the estimator as a mapping from the vector of empirical means into the parameter space yields the desired asymptotic linearity. This method for establishing the asymptotic linearity and normality of the estimator is called the functional delta method (van der Vaart and Wellner 1996; Gill 1989).},

Alternatively, one might use a TMLE defined by a choice of initial estimator, a parametric submodel that codes fluctuations of the initial estimator, and a loss function used to determine the amount of fluctuation, where either the choice of submodel or the loss function will involve inverse probability of treatment weighting. Asymptotically, such double robust estimators may have appealing properties. They can be constructed such that if either the model of the response surface or the model of the probability of treatment assignment is correct, the estimatosr will provide a consistent estimator of the average treatment effect. And if both models are correct, the weighted estimator will be asymptotically efficient. Such estimators are called double robust and locally efficient (Robins et al. 1994, 1995; Robins and Rotnitzky 1995; van der Laan and Robins 2003).},

	abstract = {The identifiability of causal effects requires sufficient variability in treatment or exposure assignment within strata of confounders. The causal inference literature refers to the assumption of adequate exposure variability within confounder strata as the assumption of positivity or experimental treatment assignment. Positivity violations can arise for two reasons. First, it may be theoretically impossible for individuals with certain covariate values to receive a given exposure of interest. For example, certain patient characteristics may constitute an absolute contraindication to receipt of a particular treatment. The threat to causal inference posed by such structural or theoretical violations of positivity does not improve with increasing sample size. Second, violations or near violations of positivity can arise in finite samples due to chance. This is a particular problem in small samples but also occurs frequently in moderate to large samples when the treatment is continuous or can take multiple levels, or when the covariate adjustment set is large or contains continuous or multilevel covariates. Regardless of the cause, causal effects may be poorly or nonidentified when certain subgroups in a finite sample do not receive some of the treatment levels of interest. In this chapter we will use the term “sparsity” to refer to positivity violations and near-violations arising from either of these causes, recognizing that other types of sparsity can also threaten valid inference.},

It is common that one wishes to assess the effect of a treatment or exposure on the time it takes for an event to occur based on an observational database. Chapters 17 and 18 discussed the treatment-specific survival curve in RCTs. The TMLE presented there improves upon common methods for analyzing time-to-event data in robustness, efficiency, and interpretability of parameter estimates. Observational data differ from RCTs in that the exposure/treatment is not set according to a known mechanism. Moreover, in situations where there is dependent censoring the censoring mechanism is also unknown. As a consequence, in observational studies, the TMLE needs to estimate the treatment and censoring mechanism, and this needs to be done in such a way that the resulting targeted bias reduction carried out by the TMLE is fully effective.},

A TMLE is based on a choice of loss function and a corresponding parametric submodel through an initial estimator, chosen so that the loss-functionspecific score of this parametric submodel at zero fluctuation equals or spans the efficient influence curve of the target parameter. Two such TMLEs are considered: one based on the squared error loss function with a linear regression model, and one based on a quasi-log-likelihood loss function with a logistic regression submodel. The problem with the first TMLE is highlighted: the linear regression model is not a submodel and thus does not respect global constraints implied by the statistical model. It is theoretically and practically demonstrated that the TMLE with the logistic regression submodel is more robust than a TMLE based on least squares linear regression. Some parts of this chapter assume familiarity with the core concepts, as presented in Chap. 5. The less theoretically trained reader should aim to navigate through these parts and focus on the practical implementation and importance of the presented TMLE procedure. This chapter is adapted from Gruber and van der Laan (2010b).},

In an attempt to create a level of quality assurance with respect to biological and more specifically biomarker research, the FDA has called for the development of a standard protocol for biomarker qualification (Food and Drug Administration 2006). Such a protocol would define “evidentiary” standards for biomarker usage in areas of drug development and disease treatment and provide a standardized assessment of a biomarker’s significance and biological interpretation. This is especially relevant for RCTs, where the protocol would prohibit the use of unauthenticated biomarkers to determine treatment regime, resulting in safer and more reliable treatment decisions (Food and Drug Administration 2006). Consequentially, identifying accurate and flexible analysis tools to assess biomarker importance is essential. In this chapter, we present a measure of variable importance based on a flexible semiparametric model as a standardized measure for biomarker importance. We estimate this measure with the TMLE.},

A key clinical question regarding the management of HIV/AIDS is when to start combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), defined in the Department of Health and Human Services (2004) guidelines as a regimen containing three or more individual antiretroviral medications. CD4+ T-cell count levels have been the primary marker used to determine treatment eligibility, although other factors have also been considered, such as HIV RNA levels, history of an AIDS-defining illness (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1992), and ability of the patient to adhere to therapy. The primary outcomes considered in ART treatment guidelines described above have always been reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Until recently, however, guidelines have not considered the effect of CD4 thresholds on the risk of specific comorbidities, such as ADC. In this analysis, we therefore evaluate how different CD4-based ART initiation strategies influence the burden of ADC. We are analyzing ADC here since it is well established that these malignancies are closely linked to immunodeficiency.},

Nowadays, more than 40,000 IVF cycles are performed each year in France and more than 63,000 in the USA (Adamson et al. 2006). Yet, how to quantify the success in assisted reproduction still remains a matter of debate. One could, for instance, rely on the number of pregnancies or deliveries per IVF cycle. However, an IVF program often consists of several successive IVF cycles. So, instead of considering each IVF cycle separately, one could rather rely on an evaluation of the whole program. IVF programs are emotionally and physically burdensome. Providing the patients with the most adequate and accurate measure of success is therefore an important issue that we propose to address in this chapter.},

Possible outcomes are time to death, time to virologic failure, and time to recurrence of cancer. The data collected on a subject accumulates over time until the minimum of the time of analysis (end of study), the time the subject drops out of the study, or until the event of interest is observed. Typically, for a large proportion of the subjects recruited into the trial, the subject is right censored before the event of interest is observed, i.e., the time of analysis or the time the subject drops out of the study occurs before the time until the event of interest. The dropout time of the subject can be related to the actual time to failure one would have observed if the person had not dropped out prematurely. In this case, the standard unadjusted estimator of a causal effect of treatment on a survival time, such as the difference of the treatment-specific Kaplan–Meier survival curves at a particular point in time, is not only inefficient by not utilizing the available covariate information, but it is also biased due to informative dropout.},

	abstract = {The statistics profession is at a unique point in history. The need for valid statistical tools is greater than ever; data sets are massive, often measuring hundreds of thousands of measurements for a single subject. The field is ready to move towards clear objective benchmarks under which tools can be evaluated. Targeted learning allows (1) the full generalization and utilization of cross-validation as an estimator selection tool so that the subjective choices made by humans are now made by the machine, and (2) targeting the fitting of the probability distribution of the data toward the target parameter representing the scientific question of interest. This book is aimed at both statisticians and applied researchers interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational and experimental data. Part I is an accessible introduction to super learning and the targeted maximum likelihood estimator, including related concepts necessary to understand and apply these methods. Parts II-IX handle complex data structures and topics applied researchers will immediately recognize from their own research, including time-to-event outcomes, direct and indirect effects, positivity violations, case-control studies, censored data, longitudinal data, and genomic studies."Targeted Learning, by Mark J. van der Laan and Sherri Rose, fills a much needed gap in statistical and causal inference. It protects us from wasting computational, analytical, and data resources on irrelevant aspects of a problem and teaches us how to focus on what is relevant – answering questions that researchers truly care about."-Judea Pearl, Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"In summary, this book should be on the shelf of every investigator who conducts observational research and randomized controlled trials. The concepts and methodology are foundational for causal inference and at the same time stay true to what the data at hand can say about the questions that motivate their collection."-Ira B.

Suppose that one is concerned with estimation of a particular pathwise differentiable Euclidean parameter. A substitution estimator evaluating the parameter of a given likelihood based density estimator is typically too biased and might not even converge at the parametric rate: that is, the density estimator was targeted to be a good estimator of the density and might therefore result in  a poor estimator of a particular smooth functional of the density. In this article we propose a one step (and, by iteration, k-th step) targeted maximum likelihood density estimator which involves 1) creating a hardest parametric submodel with parameter epsilon through the given density estimator with score  equal to the efficient influence curve of the pathwise differentiable parameter at the density estimator,  2) estimating epsilon with the maximum likelihood estimator, and 3) defining a new density estimator as the corresponding update of the original density estimator. We show that iteration of this algorithm results in a targeted maximum likelihood density estimator which solves the efficient influence curve estimating equation and thereby yields a locally efficient estimator of the parameter of interest, under regularity conditions. In particular, we show that, if the parameter is linear and the model is convex, then the targeted maximum likelihood estimator is often achieved in the first step, and it results in a locally efficient estimator at an arbitrary (e.g., heavily misspecified) starting density.We also show that the targeted maximum likelihood estimators are now in full agreement with the locally efficient estimating function methodology as presented in Robins and Rotnitzky (1992) and van der Laan and Robins (2003), creating, in particular, algebraic equivalence between the double robust locally efficient estimators using the targeted maximum likelihood estimators as an estimate of its nuisance parameters, and targeted maximum likelihood estimators. In addition, it is argued that the targeted MLE has various advantages relative to the current estimating function based approach. We proceed by providing data driven methodologies to select the initial density estimator for the targeted MLE, thereby providing data adaptive targeted maximum likelihood estimation methodology.  We illustrate the method with various worked out examples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Also we link case-control sampling with a two-sample biased sampling problem, where the ratio of two densities is assumed to take a known parametric form. Connections between this model and the Cox proportional hazards model are pointed out. Large and small sample size behaviour of the proposed estimators is studied.},

This model, arising naturally from case-control studies and logistic discriminant analyses, can also be regarded as a biased sampling model. Our proposed density estimate is therefore an extension of the kernel density estimate suggested by Jones for length-biased data. We show that under the model considered the new density estimator not only is consistent but also has the 'smallest' asymptotic variance among general nonparametric density estimators. We also show how to use the new estimate to define a procedure for testing the goodness of fit of the density ratio model. Such a test is consistent under very general alternatives.

A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression.  Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al.

Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner.  This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners.  In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions.   This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

In the situation of censored data, however, those tools are no longer directly applicable. This article provides an easily implemented methodology for modeling the association, based on censored data. The form of the regression relationship will be completely determined by the data; no assumptions are made about this form. Basic ideas behind the methodology are to transform the observed data in an appropriate simple way and then to apply a locally weighted least squares regression. The proposed estimator involves a variable bandwidth that automatically adapts to the design of the data points. That the methodology is very easy to implement is illustrated by several examples, including simulation studies and an analysis of the Stanford Heart Transplant Data and the Primary Biliary Cirrhosis Data. Several theoretical considerations are reflected in the examples. Finally, some basic asymptotic results are established.},
