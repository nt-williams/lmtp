\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in wide format containing all necessary variables
for the estimation problem.}

\item{trt}{A vector containing the column names of treatment variables ordered by time.}

\item{outcome}{The column name of the outcome variable. In the case of time-to-event
analysis, a vector containing the columns names of intermediate outcome variables and the final
outcome variable ordered by time. Only numeric values are allowed. If the outcome type
is binary, data should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{baseline}{An optional vector containing the column names of baseline covariates to be
included for adjustment at every time point.}

\item{time_vary}{A list the same length as the number of time points of observation with
the column names for new time-varying covariates introduced at each time point. The list
should be ordered following the time ordering of the model.}

\item{cens}{An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as the number of time points of observation. If missingness in the outcome is
present or if time-to-event outcome, must be provided.}

\item{shift}{A two argument function that specifies how treatment variables should be shifted.
See examples for how to specify shift functions for continuous, binary, and categorical exposures.}

\item{shifted}{An optional data frame, the same as in \code{data}, but modified according
to the treatment policy of interest. If specified, \code{shift} is ignored.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying how previous time points should be
used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{intervention_type}{The intervention type, should be one of \code{"static"},
\code{"dynamic"}, \code{"mtp"}.}

\item{outcome_type}{Outcome variable type (i.e., continuous, binomial, survival).}

\item{id}{An optional column name containing cluster level identifiers.}

\item{bounds}{An optional vector of the bounds for continuous outcomes. If \code{NULL},
the bounds will be taken as the minimum and maximum of the observed data.
Should be left as \code{NULL} if the outcome type is binary.}

\item{learners_outcome}{An optional \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the outcome
regression. If not specified, will default to using a main effects generalized linear model.}

\item{learners_trt}{An optional \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the exposure
mechanism. If not specified, will default to using a main effects generalized linear model.}

\item{folds}{The number of folds to be used for cross-fitting. Minimum allowable number
is two folds.}

\item{weights}{An optional vector of length n containing sampling weights.}

\item{.bound}{Determines that maximum and minimum values (scaled) predictions
will be bounded by. The default is 1e-5, bounding predictions by 1e-5 and 0.9999.}

\item{.trim}{Determines the amount the density ratios should be trimmed.
The default is 0.999, trimming the density ratios greater than the 0.999 percentile
to the 0.999 percentile. A value of 1 indicates no trimming.}

\item{.SL_folds}{Integer. Controls the number of splits to be used for fitting
the Super Learner. The default is 10.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{lmtp} containing the following components:

\item{estimator}{The estimator used, in this case "TMLE".}
\item{theta}{The estimated population LMTP effect.}
\item{standard_error}{The estimated standard error of the LMTP effect.}
\item{low}{Lower bound of the 95\% confidence interval of the LMTP effect.}
\item{high}{Upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval of the LMTP effect.}
\item{eif}{The estimated, un-centered, influence function of the estimate.}
\item{shift}{The shift function specifying the treatment policy of interest.}
\item{outcome_reg}{An n x Tau + 1 matrix of outcome regression predictions.
The mean of the first column is used for calculating theta.}
\item{density_ratios}{An n x Tau matrix of the estimated density ratios.}
\item{weights_m}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the Super Learner
ensemble weights at each time-point for each fold for the outcome regression.}
\item{weights_r}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the Super Learner
ensemble weights at each time-point for each fold for the propensity.}
