\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame.}

\item{trt}{A vector of column names of treatment variables.}

be introduced at each time point. The list should be ordered following
the time ordering of the model.}

included for adjustment at every timepoint.}

\item{cens}{An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as \code{A}.}

used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{shift}{A function that specifies how tratment variables should be shifted.}

\item{outcome_type}{Outcome variable type (i.e., continuous, binomial).}

\item{bounds}{An optional vector of the bounds for continuous outcomes. If NULL
the bounds will be taken as the minimum and maximum of the observed data.
Ignored if outcome type is binary.}

\item{learners_outcome}{An \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the outcome
regression.}

\item{learners_trt}{An \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the exposure
mechanism.}

\item{folds}{The number of folds to be used for cross-validation.}

\item{bound}{Determines that maximum and minimum values (scaled) predictions
will be bounded by. The default is 1e-5, bounding predictions by 1e-5 and 0.9999.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{lmtp} containing the following components:

\item{estimator}{The estimator used, in this case "SDR".}

\item{standard_error}{The estimated standard error of the LMTP effect.}
\item{low}{Lower bound of the 95\% confidence interval of the LMTP effect.}
\item{high}{Upper bound of the 95\% confidene interval of the LMTP effect.}
\item{eif}{The estimated, uncentered, influence function of the estimate.}
\item{shift}{The shift function specifying the treatment policy of interest.}
\item{weights_m}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the Super Learner
ensemble weights at each time-point for each fold for the outcome regression.}
\item{weights_r}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the Super Learner
ensemble weights at each time-point for each fold for the propensity.}
\item{outcome_type}{The outcome variable type.}
