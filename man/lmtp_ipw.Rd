\arguments{
\item{data}{[\code{data.frame}]\cr
A \code{data.frame} in wide format containing all necessary variables
for the estimation problem. Must not be a \code{data.table}.}

\item{trt}{[\code{character}]\cr
A vector containing the column names of treatment variables ordered by time.}

\item{outcome}{[\code{character}]\cr
The column name of the outcome variable. In the case of time-to-event
analysis, a vector containing the columns names of intermediate outcome variables and the final
outcome variable ordered by time. Only numeric values are allowed. If the outcome type
is binary, data should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{baseline}{[\code{character}]\cr
An optional vector containing the column names of baseline covariates to be
included for adjustment at every time point.}

\item{time_vary}{[\code{list}]\cr
A list the same length as the number of time points of observation with
the column names for new time-varying covariates introduced at each time point. The list
should be ordered following the time ordering of the model.}

\item{cens}{[\code{character}]\cr
An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as the number of time points of observation. If missingness in the outcome is
present or if time-to-event outcome, must be provided.}

\item{shift}{[\code{closure}]\cr
A two argument function that specifies how treatment variables should be shifted.
See examples for how to specify shift functions for continuous, binary, and categorical exposures.}

\item{shifted}{[\code{data.frame}]\cr
An optional data frame, the same as in \code{data}, but modified according
to the treatment policy of interest. If specified, \code{shift} is ignored.}

\item{mtp}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Is the intervention of interest a modified treatment policy?
Default is \code{FALSE}. If treatment variables are continuous this should be \code{TRUE}.}

\item{k}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
An integer specifying how previous time points should be
used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{id}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
An optional column name containing cluster level identifiers.}

\item{outcome_type}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Outcome variable type (i.e., continuous, binomial, survival).}

\item{learners}{[\code{character}]\cr A vector of \code{SuperLearner} algorithms for estimation
of the exposure mechanism. Default is \code{"SL.glm"}, a main effects GLM.
\bold{Only include candidate learners capable of binary classification}.}

\item{folds}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
The number of folds to be used for cross-fitting.}

\item{weights}{[\code{numeric(nrow(data))}]\cr
An optional vector containing sampling weights.}

\item{.bound}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
Determines that maximum and minimum values (scaled) predictions
will be bounded by. The default is 1e-5, bounding predictions by 1e-5 and 0.9999.}

\item{.trim}{[\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
Determines the amount the density ratios should be trimmed.
The default is 0.999, trimming the density ratios greater than the 0.999 percentile
to the 0.999 percentile. A value of 1 indicates no trimming.}

\item{.learners_folds}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
The number of cross-validation folds for \code{learners}.}

\item{.return_full_fits}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Return full SuperLearner fits? Default is \code{FALSE}, return only SuperLearner weights.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments. Exists for backwards compatibility.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{lmtp} containing the following components:

\item{estimator}{The estimator used, in this case "IPW".}
\item{theta}{The estimated population LMTP effect.}
\item{standard_error}{NA}
\item{low}{NA}
\item{high}{NA}
\item{shift}{The shift function specifying the treatment policy of interest.}
\item{density_ratios}{An n x Tau matrix of the estimated density ratios.}

\description{
Inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator for the effects of traditional causal
effects and modified treatment policies for both point treatment and longitudinal data
with binary, continuous, or time-to-event outcomes. Supports binary, categorical, and continuous exposures.
}
\details{
\subsection{Should \code{mtp = TRUE}?}{

A modified treatment policy (MTP) is an intervention that depends
on the natural value of the exposure (the value that the treatment would have taken under no intervention).
This differs from other causal effects,
such as the average treatment effect (ATE), where an exposure would be increased (or decreased) deterministically.
\bold{If your intervention of interest adds, subtracts, or multiplies the observed treatment values
by some amount, use \code{mtp = TRUE}}.
