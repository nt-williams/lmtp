\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in wide format containing all necessary variables
for the estimation problem.}

\item{trt}{A vector containing the column names of treatment variables ordered by time.}

\item{outcome}{The column name of the outcome variable. In the case of time-to-event
analysis, a vector containing the columns names of intermediate outcome variables and the final
outcome variable ordered by time. Only numeric values are allowed. If the outcome type
is binary, data should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{nodes}{A list the same length as the number of time points of observation with
the column names for new time-varying covariates introduced at each time point. The list
should be ordered following the time ordering of the model. Must be provided, even
if no time-varying covariates exist. In the case of a point-treatment, should be set
to \code{list(c(NULL))}. If time-to-event with a time-invariant exposure,
\code{nodes} should be the same length as the number of intermediate outcome variables
with each index of the list similiarly set to \code{NULL}. See examples for demonstration.}

\item{baseline}{An optional vector of columns names of baseline covariates to be
included for adjustment at every timepoint.}

\item{cens}{An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as \code{nodes}. If missingness in the outcome is present, must be provided.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying how many previous time points should be
used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{shift}{A function that specifies how treatment variables should be shifted. See examples
for how to specify shift functions for continuous, binary, and categorical exposures.}

\item{learners}{An \code{sl3} learner stack for estimation of the treatment mechanism.
If not specified, will default to an ensemble of an intercept only model
and a GLM.}

\item{folds}{The number of folds to be used for cross-fitting. Minimum allowable number
is two folds.}

\item{bound}{Determines that maximum and minimum values (scaled) predictions
will be bounded by. The default is 1e-5, bounding predictions by 1e-5 and 0.9999.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{lmtp} containing the following components:

\item{estimator}{The estimator used, in this case "IPW".}
\item{theta}{The estimated population LMTP effect.}
\item{standard_error}{NA}
\item{low}{NA}
\item{high}{NA}
\item{shift}{The shift function specifying the treatment policy of interest.}
\item{weights_r}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the Super Learner
ensemble weights at each time-point for each fold for the propensity.}
}
\description{
Inverse probability of treatment weighting estimator for the effects of traditional causal
effects and modified treatment policies for both point treatment and longitudinal data
with binary, continuous, or time-to-event outcomes. Supports binary, categorical, and continuous exposures.
