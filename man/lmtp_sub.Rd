\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame in wide format containing all necessary variables
for the estimation problem.}

\item{trt}{A vector containing the column names of treatment variables ordered by time.}

\item{outcome}{The column name of the outcome variable. In the case of time-to-event
analysis, a vector containing the columns names of intermediate outcome variables and the final
outcome variable ordered by time. Only numeric values are allowed. If the outcome type
is binary, data should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{baseline}{An optional vector containing the column names of baseline covariates to be
included for adjustment at every time point.}

\item{time_vary}{A list the same length as the number of time points of observation with
the column names for new time-varying covariates introduced at each time point. The list
should be ordered following the time ordering of the model.}

\item{cens}{An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as the number of time points of observation. If missingness in the outcome is
present or if time-to-event outcome, must be provided.}

\item{shift}{A two argument function that specifies how treatment variables should be shifted.
See examples for how to specify shift functions for continuous, binary, and categorical exposures.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying how previous time points should be
used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{outcome_type}{Outcome variable type (i.e., continuous, binomial, survival).}

\item{id}{An optional column name containing cluster level identifiers.}

\item{bounds}{An optional vector of the bounds for continuous outcomes. If \code{NULL},
the bounds will be taken as the minimum and maximum of the observed data.
Should be left as \code{NULL} if the outcome type is binary.}

\item{learners}{A vector of \code{SuperLearner} algorithms for estimation
of the outcome regression. Default is \code{"SL.glm"}, a main effects GLM.}

\item{folds}{The number of folds to be used for cross-fitting. Minimum allowable number
is two folds.}

\item{weights}{An optional vector of length n containing sampling weights.}

\item{.bound}{Determines that maximum and minimum values (scaled) predictions
will be bounded by. The default is 1e-5, bounding predictions by 1e-5 and 0.9999.}

\item{.SL_folds}{Integer. Controls the number of splits to be used for fitting
the Super Learner. The default is 10.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{lmtp} containing the following components:

\item{estimator}{The estimator used, in this case "substitution".}
\item{theta}{The estimated population LMTP effect.}
\item{standard_error}{NA}
\item{low}{NA}
\item{high}{NA}
\item{shift}{The shift function specifying the treatment policy of interest.}
\item{outcome_reg}{An n x Tau + 1 matrix of outcome regression predictions.
The mean of the first column is used for calculating theta.}
\item{weights_m}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the Super Learner
ensemble weights at each time-point for each fold for the outcome regression.}
\item{outcome_type}{The outcome variable type.}
