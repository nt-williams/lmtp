\arguments{
\item{data}{[\code{data.frame}]\cr
A \code{data.frame} in wide format containing all necessary variables
for the estimation problem. Must not be a \code{data.table}.}

\item{trt}{[\code{character}] or [\code{list}]\cr
A vector containing the column names of treatment variables ordered by time.
Or, a list of vectors, the same length as the number of time points of observation.
Vectors should contain column names for the treatment variables at each time point. The list
should be ordered following the time ordering of the model.}

\item{outcome}{[\code{character}]\cr
The column name of the outcome variable. In the case of time-to-event
analysis, a vector containing the columns names of intermediate outcome variables and the final
outcome variable ordered by time. Only numeric values are allowed. If the outcome type
is binary, data should be coded as 0 and 1.}

\item{baseline}{[\code{character}]\cr
An optional vector containing the column names of baseline covariates to be
included for adjustment at every time point.}

\item{time_vary}{[\code{list}]\cr
A list the same length as the number of time points of observation with
the column names for new time-varying covariates introduced at each time point. The list
should be ordered following the time ordering of the model.}

\item{cens}{[\code{character}]\cr
An optional vector of column names of censoring indicators the same
length as the number of time points of observation. If missingness in the outcome is
present or if time-to-event outcome, must be provided.}

\item{conditional}{[\code{matrix}]\cr
An optional matrix indicating which observations are within the treatment
conditioning set at each time point. The matrix should have one column for each
time point and one row for each observation.}

\item{shift}{[\code{closure}]\cr
A two argument function that specifies how treatment variables should be shifted.
See examples for how to specify shift functions for continuous, binary, and categorical exposures.}

\item{shifted}{[\code{data.frame}]\cr
An optional data frame, the same as in \code{data}, but modified according
to the treatment policy of interest. If specified, \code{shift} is ignored.}

\item{k}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
An integer specifying how previous time points should be
used for estimation at the given time point. Default is \code{Inf},
all time points.}

\item{outcome_type}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Outcome variable type (i.e., continuous, binomial, survival).}

\item{id}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
An optional column name containing cluster level identifiers.}

\item{bounds}{[\code{numeric(2)}]\cr
An optional, ordered vector of the bounds for a continuous outcomes. If \code{NULL},
the bounds will be taken as the minimum and maximum of the observed data.
Should be left as \code{NULL} if the outcome type is binary.}

\item{learners}{[\code{character}]\cr A vector of \code{mlr3superlearner} algorithms for estimation
of the outcome regression. Default is \code{c("mean", "glm")}.}

\item{folds}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
The number of folds to be used for cross-fitting.}

\item{weights}{[\code{numeric(nrow(data))}]\cr
An optional vector containing sampling weights.}

\item{control}{[\code{list()}]\cr
Output of \code{lmtp_control()}.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{lmtp} containing the following components:

\item{estimator}{The estimator used, in this case "substitution".}
\item{theta}{The estimated population LMTP effect.}
\item{standard_error}{NA}
\item{low}{NA}
\item{high}{NA}
\item{shift}{The shift function specifying the treatment policy of interest.}
\item{outcome_reg}{An n x Tau + 1 matrix of outcome regression predictions.
The mean of the first column is used for calculating theta.}
\item{fits_m}{A list the same length as \code{folds}, containing the fits at each time-point
for each fold for the outcome regression.}
\item{outcome_type}{The outcome variable type.}
